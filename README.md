# CartDemo
Small project to simulate the workings of an ecommerce backend
---

## Overview
- Basic Spring Security auth with JdbcUserDetailsManager
- Entity relationships between Carts, Orders, Items, and Users
- Mapping of Items to CartItems and OrderItems to decouple the items being displayed
- NO payment integration, checkout is simulated (skeleton project to mess around with modeling entities for ecommerce)
- Products are stored and retrieved from an SQL DB, with the ability to search for items by name
- ints used over floats for simplicity
- Users can browse items, add items to cart, and checkout to create an order

**Tools/Frameworks**
- Java Spring Boot
- HTMX, Thymeleaf
- mySQL
- CSS (style.css generated by AI!)
